# About

The pong game, made simple with p5.js.
this project was made for testing with git, and to be my first repository here.
I'm a computer science student at the federal university of ceara.


# To execute

You need a simple server to run the game, I used VS code's Live Server.

# Controls

Player 1: "W" up and "S" down
Player 2: "Arrow Up" for up and "Arrow Down" for down
